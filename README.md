# AirZone_proposal
Proposal for Rmd files related to AIrZone Reporting

### Remarks:

The submission is found in submission.pdf (knit from submission.Rmd).

The file bid_1.Rmd is a parameterized Rmd file using simulated data which is comparable to your Ozone and PM25 data.

The file bid_1.html is the knit output from bid_1.Rmd for fictional airzone "Alpha".  Note that coloured table cells are currently not supported in gt() for latex/pdf outputs, but I have posted an issue to the gt() repo and this request has now been received.
